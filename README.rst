===============

* It's so cool, because the exhaustive code is already done, you just worry with the specific problems of your project
* My code has never been so beautiful :) // `The zen of Python <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_
* Now more technical.. It's very compreensive and useful tutorial, which deals with Model, Views, Templates, Django Admin and another tips and features realy useful to introduce you to the Django
